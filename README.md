# Outage-system-2.0
A better UI/UX of the outage system.
Initial outage system was aimed at just learning the backend which was php. Better back end will use better UI and more javascript into the code
will also intergrate google maps. Worked on the database, front end and backend of this app, UI was developed using bootstrap and JS, backend PHP and mysql for the database.
